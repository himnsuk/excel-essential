[20 very popular Excel shortcuts](https://exceljet.net/blog/20-very-popular-excel-shortcuts)

> Select visible cells only - Alt + ; (Mac: command + shift + Z). The trick to copying only what you see. Priceless when you're manually hiding rows and columns. 

> Toggle filters - Control + Shift + L (Mac: Command + Shift + F). An excellent shortcut to apply and clear all filters. It's a very handy way to "reset" a table with many filters applied...just use it twice.

[Convert an Excel table to a range of data](https://support.office.com/en-us/article/convert-an-excel-table-to-a-range-of-data-0b326ff1-1764-4ebe-84ea-786265d41c77

> Note: Table features are no longer available after you convert the table back to a range. For example, the row headers no longer include the sort and filter arrows, and structured references (references that use table names) that were used in formulas turn into regular cell references.)

> When you press the Alt key, letters appear in small images, called KeyTips, next to tabs and commands on the ribbon, as shown in the following image.

[Edit the active cell](https://exceljet.net/keyboard-shortcuts/edit-the-active-cell)

> Once you are editing a cell, you can use the F2 / Ctrl+U again to toggle through available edit modes (edit, enter, point).  "Point" and "Enter" work similarly and allow you to point to a cell. "Edit" mode simply moves the cursor in the formula text. Pressing F2 / Ctrl+U repeatedly will cycle through modes...you'll see the mode displayed in the status bar, in the lower left corner.

[Stop Using Your Mouse](https://www.wallstreetoasis.com/blog/stop-using-your-mouse)

    To navigate to the end of a column or row, press control and left or right, down or up. This will shoot you to the end of the data. You may have to press twice or more depending on if there is empty data in between the beginning and end. To highlight this data, press control + shift and left or right, down or up.

    Shift + space bar highlights entire row
    Control + space bar highlights entire column
    ... After doing either of those, press Control and + to add a column (or row).

    Use Alt+tab to move between different programs (word, internet, excel, etc.)

    In order to use the toolbar at the top, press ALT, which will then highlight all the functions at the top. The more you familiarize yourself with these letters, (ex: Alt + H + D + R, which deletes row in Excel 2007), the quicker they will be.

    To enter a cell to adjust a formula or just to view which cells are in use, press F2.
    Use the F4 function to create absolutes on formulas within cells. Based on how many times you press, you will receive varying functions, ex: $C$2, $C2, C$2. View the Code section of the DATA tab within my spreadsheet to see further. The $ keeps the cell from moving when copying formulas down or across.

    When you are in a cell that is pulling data from another tab or another section within the tab you are in, press Control + [ to jump to that cell. You can use F5 + enter to return back to your original tab and cell.
